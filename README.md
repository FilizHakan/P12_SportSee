<h3>Project :</h3>
For this project, we need to design a dashboard showing a user's performances while exercising. Therefore, anyone using the dasboard can keep up with his/her own performances on a weekly and/or daily basis. Only the desktop version is required (1024px x 780px) for this sprint. We use Figma to base the dashboard model.

<h3>Model in Figma: </h3>
